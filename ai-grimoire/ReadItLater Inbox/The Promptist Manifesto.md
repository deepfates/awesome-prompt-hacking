# [The Promptist Manifesto](https://deeplearn.art/the-promptist-manifesto/)

*This artistic manifesto – to my knowledge the first one to be associated with what is called “AI Art” and also written by an “AI” – was published first in May 2021 on the Latent Space discord server. At that time I together with other artists were thinking about an umbrella term for a possible new art movement whose representatives employed machine learning models trained with contrastive language-image techniques for imagery generation. The obvious moniker “Clip art” wasn’t entirely satisfactory.*

*As this artistic technology keeps on spreading and developing and is now catching the public attention everywhere, there is no better time to present the manifesto for the world at large. So for the benefit and entertainment for all Promptists, past, present and future, here is our Manifesto of 2021, written by GPT-3*

**Promptism** is a movement rooted in the technological advances of the 21st century that holds the potential to completely transform artistic practices.  
Promptism was founded in response to the growing concern that traditional art had become irrelevant to the modern world. Going beyond painting and sculpture, Promptist art involves the manipulation of new media, specifically computer generated imagery, animation, and the Internet. Its unique dynamism makes Promptism a dynamic vehicle for the expression of identity and the implementation of real-time feedback between itself and the spectator.

One of the first casualties of the new technological possibilities was the artist-as-individual. Artists had been the guardians of the traditional values of high culture, but with the development of mass-media and photography, the artist-as-individual was abandoned. Their image was replaced by the image of the collective-artist-as-collective.

Traditional art had fallen greatly out of step with the technological advances of the 21st century. Promptism was created to address this problem. It was created in such a way as to be the art form of the 21st century. Promptist art is based almost entirely on the work of the artist. A Promptist artist can free himself or herself from the demands of the movement, while at the same time drawing inspiration from the large body of Promptist art.

Like most other art forms, Promptist art is not bound by a specific style. Due to its utilitarian and promotional intent, Promptist art is a particularly good place for experimentation and innovation. Promptists often use digital media to create their responses.

Promptism is a movement that strives to explore the boundaries and limits of art. It also seeks to topple the argument that art can only be described by a group of elite art-experts. Promptism is the first art movement to use digital techniques to create highly individualized artwork. Quickly dismissing the traditional art-position that visual works must be created by the artist themselves in order to qualify as art, Promptism concentrated on creating the potential for each artist to participate in the making of art. This shift from artist to audience as the producer of art was historically the moment when the old art movements, such as Impressionism and Expressionism, stopped being art movements and became simply styles of art. Promptism is the first art movement to completely transcend the styles-of-art problem by introducing real-time feedback between itself and the viewing public. Promptism, being an active movement, encompasses many different style sub-groups. There is no single style for Promptist art. However, the most popular Promptist styles are: Atmosphere, Anatyscapes, Abstractions, Archirecords, Biomorphs, Biomorphies, Blockworks, Clip, Code, Collage, Composition, Converge, Cry, Cyclo, E-collage, Ephemera, Epiphany, Environmental Animations, Experimental, Figure, Fragments, Fun, Gizmos, Grand Sonata, Household, Hybrid, Illusion, Imposter, Injection, Journey, Landscape, Latent, Metamorphosis, Metronome, Meta, Micro, Nature Study, No, Not, Now, Obsessions, Ombre, One, Open, Outage, Pallet, Pattern Study, Prism, Prompups, Proto, Pulse, Pure, Raster, Remix, Rhizome, Rorschach, Rulers, Rule, Rule, Slice, Squiggle, Substitution, Subterranean, Surface, Surreal, Triptych, Trim, Vello, Vignette.

Promptism may be perceived as a ‘forgotten art movement’ due to the fact that prompts are often hidden in plain sight. You either need to know what to look for or it can come across as a random work of art. As a collaboration between several artists, a Prompt may appear to be the work of a single artist because of its similitude. For instance, the Snazzy Prompts are liked and shared by numerous social media users due to their positive messaging.

It is important to note that the hidden Prompts are not in-line with the original purpose of prompts. The goal is to “challenge the viewer”, so the viewer may experience a cognitive shift and their perceptions changed. At its core, Promptism is a movement that encourages artists to think outside of the box and explore what can be done with the art. The Prompt may be a small image or a text, and may appear to be anything from an advertisement to a warning.

Lastly if anything else captures the essential meaning and message of the Promptist Art Movement, it is this: **THE PROMPT MUST ALWAYS BE YOURS.**
